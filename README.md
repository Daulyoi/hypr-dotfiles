# ML4W Slight Rice

## Overview

Personal collection of ML4W dotfiles with small, customizations to suit my likings.

Included files (customized):
- fastfetch (shows "Cachy OS" instead of logo)
- fish (ohmyposh)
- hypr (uses nwg-displays for monitor)
- waybar (appearance and module placement)

These are the main files I tweaked to fit my workflow and appearance preferences.

## Want to use these in your setup? 

1. Follow the installation instructions on [ML4W github](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles) 
2. Replace the default ML4W configuration files by copying your desired dotfiles into the installed locations. Make sure to overwrite the originals.
